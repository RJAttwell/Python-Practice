friends = ["Kevin", "Raquis", "Rock Lee", "Pooface Mcgee", "AHHHH"]

print(friends[1])

#print(friends[1:])
#1: will grab index 1 and all indexes after that.
#:1 will grab all indexes before 1

#print(friends[1:4])
#[1:4] indicates a range so it will only print off the names between 1 and 4 (Not including 4)
